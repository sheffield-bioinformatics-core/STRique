STRique is a python package to analyze repeat expansion and methylation states of short tandem repeats (STR) in Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long read sequencing data.

To get started the **[installation](installation/prerequisites.md)** chapter describes the available installation options depending on the operation system, available hardware and already existing environments.

In the **[Usage](examples/intro.md)** chapter the stepwise analysis of nanopore reads covering repeat expansions is demonstrated.
